## 🏗️ Architecture Enhancements

### 1. Structured Prompt Engineering

Each worker now uses detailed, structured prompts that request specific information:

**Traffic Worker Sections:**

* 🚦 Current Conditions
* 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
* 🚨 Immediate Actions
* 🏗️ Long-term Solutions
* 📊 Impact Assessment

**Energy Worker Sections:**

* ⚡ Current Energy Patterns
* 💡 Efficiency Opportunities
* 💰 Cost-Saving Measures
* 🌱 Sustainability Improvements
* 🗓️ Implementation Timeline

**Safety Worker Sections:**

* 🚨 Risk Assessment
* ⚠️ Immediate Safety Concerns
* 🛡️ Preventive Measures
* 🚒 Emergency Response Plans
* 👥 Community Safety Recommendations

**Environment Worker Sections:**

* 🌍 Environmental Impact Assessment
* 🌱 Sustainability Recommendations
* 🏭 Pollution Control Measures
* 🌳 Green Infrastructure Suggestions
* 📋 Compliance and Regulations

---

### 2. New Environment Worker

The `EnvironmentWorker` class extends the system to handle:

* Air quality monitoring
* Pollution control strategies
* Sustainability initiatives
* Environmental compliance
* Green infrastructure planning

---

### 3. Intelligent Coordination

The `CityCoordinator` now includes:

* `analyze_relevance()`: Uses LLM to determine which specialists should handle each request
* `coordinate_smart_monitoring()`: Provides insights about worker relevance before processing

---

## 🔧 Key Implementation Details

### Semantic Kernel 1.36.2 Compatibility

* Uses `KernelFunctionFromPrompt` for function creation
* Proper service configuration with `AzureChatCompletion`
* Async/await patterns for efficient LLM calls

### Error Handling

* Graceful exception handling with `return_exceptions=True`
* Clear error messages for troubleshooting
* Continued operation even if individual workers fail

### Scalability

* Easy to add new specialized workers
* Modular architecture
* Parallel processing of worker requests

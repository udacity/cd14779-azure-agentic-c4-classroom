## 🏗️ Detailed Workflow

### Phase 1: Document Processing Pipeline

#### Step 1.1: Document Ingestion
```python
# Documents are loaded from Azure Blob Storage
documents = [
    "financial_report_2024.md",
    "technical_spec_ai_platform.md", 
    "market_analysis_q1.md",
    "product_roadmap.md",
    "competitive_analysis_2024.md"  # 🆕 New competitive document
]
```

#### Step 1.2: Intelligent Classification & Chunking
```python
# System automatically classifies documents by domain
document → ChromaDB Collection:
- Financial documents → "financial" collection
- Technical documents → "technical" collection  
- Market research → "market" collection
- Competitive analysis → "market" collection  # 🆕 Competitive docs
```

#### Step 1.3: Vector Embedding Storage
```python
# Documents are chunked and embedded for semantic search
chunk_document(content, chunk_size=500, overlap=50)
→ Store in ChromaDB with metadata
→ Enable fast, intelligent retrieval
```

### Phase 2: Multi-Agent Analysis Engine

#### Step 2.1: Parallel Agent Deployment
```python
# Four specialized agents deploy simultaneously
agents = {
    "financial": FinancialRetrievalAgent(...),
    "technical": TechnicalRetrievalAgent(...), 
    "market": MarketRetrievalAgent(...),
    "competitive": CompetitiveIntelligenceAgent(...)  # 🆕 New agent
}
```

#### Step 2.2: Domain-Specific Semantic Search
**Financial Agent**: Searches "financial" collection for revenue, profit, growth metrics  
**Technical Agent**: Searches "technical" collection for architecture, performance data  
**Market Agent**: Searches "market" collection for trends, customer insights  
**Competitive Agent**: 🆕 Searches "market" collection for competitor analysis, market share

#### Step 2.3: Intelligent Document Retrieval
```python
# Each agent performs semantic search
search_results = chroma_manager.semantic_search(
    query=research_topic,
    collection_names=["respective_collection"],
    n_results=5
)
```

#### Step 2.4: Domain Expertise Analysis
Each agent applies specialized AI analysis:

- **Financial Analyst**: 
  ```python
  "Analyze revenue trends, profit margins, financial risks"
  → Output: Financial performance insights
  ```

- **Technical Analyst**:
  ```python
  "Evaluate architecture, scalability, technical capabilities"  
  → Output: Technical assessment
  ```

- **Market Analyst**:
  ```python
  "Study market trends, customer behavior, industry dynamics"
  → Output: Market intelligence
  ```

- **Competitive Intelligence Analyst**: 🆕
  ```python
  "Analyze competitive landscape, market positioning, competitor strengths"
  → Output: Competitive strategy recommendations
  ```

### Phase 3: Cross-Domain Synthesis

#### Step 3.1: Agent Results Integration
```python
# Synthesis agent receives analysis from all four agents
agent_results = [
    financial_analysis,
    technical_analysis, 
    market_analysis,
    competitive_analysis  # 🆕 Now includes competitive insights
]
```

#### Step 3.2: Intelligent Synthesis Process
```python
# Synthesis prompt combines all domain perspectives
prompt = """
Combine insights from:
- Financial performance data
- Technical capabilities  
- Market trends
- Competitive landscape  # 🆕 New competitive dimension

Generate integrated recommendations...
"""
```

#### Step 3.3: Comprehensive Report Generation
The synthesis agent creates reports that connect insights across all domains:

```
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
• Financial: 15% revenue growth, strong margins
• Technical: Scalable architecture supporting 1M+ users  
• Market: 45% AI adoption growth
• Competitive: 🆕 15% market share, key differentiators

INTEGRATED RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Leverage technical strengths for competitive advantage
2. Target growth segments identified in market analysis
3. Address competitive threats with strategic positioning
```

# 🍽️ Restaurant Recommendation System - Complete Solution

## 🎉 Solution Overview

This complete restaurant recommendation system demonstrates a working **multi-agent architecture** with three specialized agents and three orchestration patterns.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Three Specialist Agents

1. **🍽️ Cuisine Agent** — Recommends food types and dishes
2. **📍 Location Agent** — Suggests dining areas and neighborhoods
3. **💰 Price Agent** — Provides budget guidance and cost estimates

### Three Orchestration Patterns

#### 1. Sequential Pattern

```
Request → Cuisine → Location → Price
```

* Step-by-step recommendation process
* Each agent builds on previous context
* Comprehensive, interconnected advice

#### 2. Parallel Pattern

```
Request → [All Agents Simultaneously] → Combined Results
```

* All agents work concurrently
* Fastest response time
* Independent recommendations

#### 3. Conditional Pattern

```
Request → Analysis → [Only Relevant Agents]
```

* Smart agent selection based on request content
* Efficient resource usage
* Targeted recommendations

## 🔧 Key Implementation Details

### Enhanced Agent Prompts

**Cuisine Agent**

* Recommends 2–3 cuisine types
* Explains why each fits the request
* Suggests popular dishes
* Considers dietary needs

**Location Agent**

* Recommends neighborhoods/areas
* Describes atmosphere
* Provides transportation tips
* Suggests best visiting times

**Price Agent**

* Provides price ranges ($, $$, $$$)
* Estimates costs per person
* Offers value-for-money tips
* Suggests cost-saving strategies

### Smart Conditional Logic

The conditional orchestration uses simple keyword analysis:

* **Cuisine needed**: `food, cuisine, italian, mexican, asian, type, kind`
* **Location needed**: `where, location, area, neighborhood, place`
* **Price needed**: `price, budget, cost, cheap, expensive, $, money`

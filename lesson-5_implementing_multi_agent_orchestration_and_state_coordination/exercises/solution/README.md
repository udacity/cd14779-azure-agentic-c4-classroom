# ☕ Coffee Shop Multi-Agent System — Solution

## 🎯 Solution Overview

This solution demonstrates a **complete multi-agent coffee shop system** featuring **state coordination**, **conflict detection**, and **resource management**.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### 1️⃣ Data Models

**`CoffeeOrder`** — Tracks order lifecycle:
`received → preparing → brewing → ready → served`

**`CoffeeResource`** — Manages equipment with capacity limits:

* Espresso machines (capacity: 2)
* Milk steamers (capacity: 3)
* Coffee grinders (capacity: 2)

**`CoffeeShopState`** — Centralized state coordinating all agents:

* Order tracking
* Resource allocation
* Inventory management
* Completion statistics

---

### 2️⃣ Agent Specialization

**☕ OrderAgent**

* Manages order prioritization
* Provides customer service recommendations
* Tracks order status progression

**👨‍🍳 BaristaAgent**

* Handles equipment allocation
* Detects resource conflicts
* Provides coffee preparation strategies

**📦 InventoryAgent**

* Monitors supply levels
* Provides restocking alerts
* Tracks popular coffee types

---

## 🔄 State Coordination Features

### ⚙️ Resource Allocation Example

```python
def process_order(self, order_id: str) -> bool:
    # Allocate espresso machine and grinder
    if (self.shop_state.allocate_resource("espresso_machine_1") and
        self.shop_state.allocate_resource("coffee_grinder")):
        # Process order...
        # Release resources when done
        self.shop_state.release_resource("espresso_machine_1")
        self.shop_state.release_resource("coffee_grinder")
        return True
    return False
```

---

### 🚨 Conflict Detection

* Resources have limited capacity
* Allocation fails if a resource is full
* Proper error handling for busy equipment

---

### 🧾 Inventory Management

* Tracks coffee beans, milk, sugar, and cups
* Automatically deducts stock during order processing
* Provides **low-stock alerts**

---

## 🎪 Demo Scenarios Explained

### ☕ Scenario 1: *Check Current Order Status*

* `OrderAgent` analyzes pending orders
* Provides prioritization recommendations
* Displays current order distribution

### 🔧 Scenario 2: *Manage Coffee Machine Resources*

* `BaristaAgent` checks equipment status
* Identifies bottlenecks
* Suggests conflict resolution strategies

### 📦 Scenario 3: *Check Inventory Levels*

* `InventoryAgent` monitors supplies
* Provides restocking recommendations
* Lists popular coffee types

### ⚡ Scenario 4: *Service Efficiency*

* All agents collaborate
* Analyze order completion rate
* Offer process optimization suggestions

### 🔁 Scenario 5: *Process Improvement*

* Agents collaborate on workflow enhancement
* Provide end-to-end operational insights
* Recommend continuous improvement ideas
